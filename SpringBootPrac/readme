Step 1: Initialize the Spring Boot Project 

1.  Go to  https://start.spring.io/ 

2.  Select "Maven" as the build tool. 

3.  Add dependencies: 
○  Spring Web (for REST API development) 
○  Spring Data JPA (for database interactions) 
○  Lombok (to reduce boilerplate code) 
○  MySQL Driver (to connect with MySQL database) 
                    
4.  Click "Generate" to download the project as a ZIP file. 
                    
Step 2: Import the Project into Spring Tool Suite (STS) 
5.  Extract the ZIP file to a known location. 
                    
6.  Open Spring Tool Suite (STS). 
                    
7.  Go to File → Import → Existing Maven Projects. 
                    
8.  Browse to the extracted folder and click "Finish" to import the project. 
                    
Step 3: Create the User Entity Class 
                    
9.  Navigate to src/main/java/com/example/demo. 
                    
10. Right-click on com.example.demo → New → Class. 
                    
11. Name the class User.java and define attributes with @Entity, @Id, and @Column annotations.
                    
Step 4: Create the Repository Interface 
                    
12. Right-click on com.example.demo → New → Interface. 
                    
13. Name it UserRepo.java. 
                    
14. Extend JpaRepository<User, Long> to provide built-in database operations. 
                    
Step 5: Create the Service Interface 
                    
15. Right-click on com.example.demo → New → Interface. 
                    
16. Name it UserService.java.
                    
17. Define CRUD methods for user operations.
                    
Step 6: Create the Controller Class 
                    
18. Right-click on com.example.demo → New → Class. 
                    
19. Name it UserController.java. 
                    
20.  Use @RestController and @RequestMapping("/users") to define API endpoints. 
                    
Step 7: Run the Spring Boot Application 
                    
21.  Navigate to src/main/java/com/example/demo/DemoApplication.java. 
                    
22.  Run DemoApplication.java as a Spring Boot application. 
                    
23.  If everything is correct, you should see an output similar to: 
Started DemoApplication in 19.315 seconds (process running for 20.799) 
                                           
24.  Verify the database connection: The user table should be created in the MySQL database 
automatically.
